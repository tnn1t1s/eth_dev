This repo collects study notes and code for the Udemy online course at https://www.udemy.com/course/ethereum-and-solidity-the-complete-developers-guide/learn/lecture/8784912#overview

# March 6, 2021
I'm more than halfway done the course. By far, the most challenging part has been rewriting the contracts in Solidity 8.0 and dealing with the move from `web3` to `ethers`

# TODO
- migrate all the contract test code to use `ethers` 
- cleanup the lottery web application
- write docstrings and a medium post
- start building the NFT transfer capabilities
