"Ethereum and Solidity, the Complete Developers Guide" is an online course offerd by Udemy and presented by Steve Brehtin. The course is outdated at this point and the examples require significant reworking to run on a modern Ethereum software stack. The repo presents updated examples using the following:
 * Ports from web3 to the Ethers library
 * Updated to support Solidity > 0.8
 * Next examples using Next v.X with React v.X
 * Added tests and standalone utilities for Infura integration on Ropsten network
